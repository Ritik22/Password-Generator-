# Password-Generator-
Written in C++ a comfortable for users system of automatic generation of strong passwords according to the user-selected subject. There are 10 subjects each of them has 10 variants of password word for random selection. As a result the programm outputs 5 different password versions, each of them includes also the random selected number and sign. This is mostly a demo programm, but it was designed to be easily scalable within minimum changes. And what is specially importants for users- all the passwords are easy to remember. The programm uses 4 parallel threads and mutexes to controll their access to shared resources, what makes it pretty fast. Moreover, the programm strongly supports the encapsulation principle, all the critical data is hidden in classes, data is structured and contains comments for easy reviewing by other —Åolleagues.
